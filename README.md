# Introduction
This is a fun little project created in python. It will fetch random image from [Unsplash](https://source.unsplash.com/) and random caption from [randomtextgenerator](https://randomtextgenerator.com/). Then it will post it on instagram using [Instabot](https://github.com/instagrambot/instabot).

# How to run 

  1. Fulfill requirements in ```requirements.txt```(i.e. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```).
  2. Replace username and password with your credentials and run it with
     ```python main.py```.
